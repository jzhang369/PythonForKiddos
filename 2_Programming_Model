# Model

+ A tirelessly robot (i.e., your computer) who
  + follows your orders (i.e., your program)
  + eats data (i.e., input)
  + displays data (i.e., output)

+ What, when, and how data is eatten or displayed are decided by your orders

# Robots

Robots speak different languages as we do for English, Chinese, Spanish, and etc., 

+ Python
+ C/C++
+ Javascript
+ ......

And your program has to speak its language **correctly** so that the robot can understand.

# Inputs

Inputs are taken from

+ Terminal
+ Keyboard/Mouse
+ Camera
+ Microphone
+ ......

---
# Outputs

Outputs are given through

+ Terminal as text/words
+ Speakers
+ Photos
+ Animations
+ .......

### Put Them Together Again

---

#### Put Them Into The Context of Our Programming Env



---
# A Few Examples

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

---
# A Few Examples

```python
input("Write Something Here:")
```

---
# A Few Examples

```python
msg = input("Write Something Here:")
print(msg)
```

---
# A Few Questions
+ Does a robot has to read something from the input?
+ Does a robot has to deliver something to the output? 
+ Does a robot has to read something first, process it, and then deliver the output?

# One More Thing Before We Proceed

Can anyone tell me what is this symbol, "**=**" for?


---
# One More Thing Before We Proceed

Can anyone tell me what is this symbol, "**=**" for?

+ In programming, "**=**" is for **assign**, not for **equal**
+ Copy the data from the right side to the left side

So please get yourself comfortable with something like ```x=x+1```
